# Lightweight Systems Manager (LSM)

This is a systems configuration management system, similar to Ruby or Chef, but much more lightweight. It doesn't require Java, Apache, Nginx, a database or anything else. It uses the server/client model and stores everything in files within the */etc/lsm* folder.
